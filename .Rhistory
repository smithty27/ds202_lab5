### Problem 1.3
```{r}
#1.3 what is the number of accidents with at least one drunk driver (use variable DRUNK_DR)?
drunk=subset(acc, acc$DRUNK_DR > 0 )
nrow(drunk)
```
Response: Number of accidents with at least one drunk driver are 8769.
# Part 2: connecting Data
```{r}
#Filter by Person 1 and join with accident data
part2 <- per %>%
filter(PER_TYP==1) %>%
right_join(acc)
#Tally of day_week, hour and sex
day <- part2 %>%
group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>%
summarize(count = n())
day$DAY_WEEK <- as.factor(day$DAY_WEEK)
levels(day$DAY_WEEK) <-   c("Su","M","T","W","Th","F","Sa")
hour <- part2 %>%
group_by(HOUR) %>%
summarize(hour = n())
part2$SEX <- as.factor(part2$SEX)
levels(part2$SEX) <- c("M","F","U","U")
part2$SEX[is.na(part2$SEX)] <- "U"
sex <- part2 %>%
group_by(SEX) %>%
summarize(gender = n())
```
The code above creates the subetted and joined data and then the summarized data frames to eventually tally/visualize the requested results.
### Part 2 Visualizations
```{r}
day
day %>%
ggplot(aes(x=DAY_WEEK,y=count))+ geom_col() + labs(x="Day of the Week",y="Count of Accidents",title="Bar Plot of Accidents on Each Day of the Week")
```
In the plot above, we see that the weekend dates, Friday and Saturday, both have the most accidents. This is most likely due to most people being off and traveling more on the weekends, plus a likely abundance of drunk driving. There is also a distance third-place with Sunday, also a travel day, but it likely has fewer cases of drunk driving, or perhaps some early in the morning (i.e if someone was up late on Saturday night/Sunday morning).
```{r}
hour
hour %>%
filter(HOUR<90) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=HOUR,y=hour))+ geom_line() + geom_point() + labs(x="Time",y="Count of Accidents",title="Plot of Accidents during Each Hour")
```
In the bar plot above, we see that from midnight to 11 am, there are not many accidents. After 11 am, there are more accidnets occurring, and that continues to rise until 5 pm, when there becomes fewer accidents, with a sharp decrease after 7 pm. The number continues to drop until returning to numbers similar to the early morning at the 11 pm to midnight timeframe.
```{r}
sex
sex %>%
filter(SEX %in% c("M","F")) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=SEX,y=gender))+ geom_col() + labs(x="Sex",y="Count of Accidents",title="Bar Plot of Accidents by Sex")
```
The barplot above shows that males appear to have significantly more accidents than females.

part3_2 <- part3_1 %>%

part3_sum$region <- tolower(part3_sum$`State Name`)
part3_sum$subregion <- tolower(part3_sum$`County Name`)

#county %>%
#    ggplot(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group)) + geom_path() + coord_map()
```
Above is the plot requested. In the plot, we see that there are white spaces where we do not have data in the accident data frame. There are a few red spots, likely due to the population sizes of certain counties. Towards the bottom left, there are red spots, including the maximum number of accidents, in the Los Angeles area and surrounding counties. You can also see the San Francisco and Phoenix areas highlighted as well. Chicago is clearly red in the midwest, and various parts of Texas including Houston and Dallas are also high in accidents.
```{r}
state <- map_data('state')
part3_summer <- part3_2 %>%
filter(MONTH %in% c(4:9)) %>%
mutate(region = tolower(`State Name`)) %>%
group_by(region) %>%
summarize(count = n())
part3_winter <- part3_2 %>%
filter(MONTH %in% c(1:3,10:12)) %>%
mutate(region = tolower(`State Name`)) %>%
group_by(region) %>%
summarize(count = n())
part3_season <- data.frame(region=part3_winter$region,diff = (part3_summer$count-part3_winter$count))
part3_final <- part3_season %>%
inner_join(state)
part3_final %>%
ggplot(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group)) + geom_path() + geom_polygon(aes(fill=diff))  + scale_fill_gradient(low='blue',high='red')+coord_map() + labs(x="Longitude",y="Latitude",title="Choropleth Plot of the Difference Accidents from Summer to Winter")
```
The above map displays the United States with the difference in accidents from the summer (April through Sept.) to the winter (Oct. through March). Higher values, also in red, mean that there are more accidents in the summer, while blue displays have more in the winter months.
Some takeaways from this plot are that Florida and Texas both have many more accidents in the winter months, likely from increased traffic as more people travel to the south during these months. The flip side is that states like Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York appear to have more accidents during the summer. I will chalk that up to more people visiting these states in the warmer months, as well as people simply not driving as carefully without snow or ice on the roads.
